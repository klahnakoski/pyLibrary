# More SQL Parsing Tests

The test suite has over 400 tests.

## Running Tests

For __Linux__:

	git clone https://github.com/klahnakoski/mo-sql-parsing.git
	cd mo-sql-parsing
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
    export PYTHONPATH=.	
	python -m unittest discover tests

 For __Windows__:

	pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r tests\requirements.txt
    set PYTHONPATH=.    
    python.exe -m unittest discover tests

### Debugging Suggestions

Once you have written a failing test, you can use `with Debugger():` in your test to print out a trace of matching attempts.
